# vwk
A V webkit experiment

## What is this
VWK is an experiment in making a simple window using the WebView libraries. This project will likely only last a little while, and is not meant to be taken seriously. 

## Why?
I saw the development of the V browser and thought my experiments could help with making the V browser in general, and be "the first" to make something.

I will NOT use Webkit2GTK, but rather WPE or whatever I can get to work that doesn't need some other library (i.e. GTK, Qt, etc). I want this to be as library agnostic as possible - outside of WebKit of course.
